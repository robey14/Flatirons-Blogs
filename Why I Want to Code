# Why I Want to Code
I decided I wanted to learn to code after years in the electronics industry helping people trouble shoot their issues. I have always had a passion for video games and computers and I would love to make video games at some point. Coding is a skill that will be useful for the rest of our lives and I wanted to learn something that will keep me continually challenged and allow me to learn new things daily.  I am currently a sales represntative for a Verizon Wireless retailer and I have realized I am better with the systems and the technical side of things than most others that I work with so I have finally decided to learn to code.
